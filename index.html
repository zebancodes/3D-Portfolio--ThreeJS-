      <h2>📜 About Me 📜 </h2>
      <p>
        *Record Scratch* Yep, that's me, you're probably wondering how I got here. It all started back in 1998, a child
        was born on a Tuesday afternoon in November. One drop of the head later; I woke up 23 years later, a student in
        Computer Science,
        Studying at Franklin University remotely from Orlando, FL with a tenative graduation of November 2023.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jokes aside, I graduated from Central Ohio Technical College in 2021 with an Associate's Degree, double major in
        IT Specialism and Software Programming Development.
        I originally intended to stop there, but once I got close to graduation, I decided I wanted to continue and
        develop my skills in Computer Science at Franklin University.

      </p>

      <p>
        As of right now, I am currently looking for Software Engineering Internships/Full-Time positions, preferably
        remote or around Orlando, FL area.
      </p>

      <h2>🎸 Bio 🎸</h2>
      <p>I am an avid fan of video games, whether it be discussing the most niche game on the GameCube to raiding in
        World of Warcraft! Some of my other interests are lifting and writing/playing music (Really into rock/metal and
        hiphop). Being in Orlando, my wife and I like to spend time going to Universal and Disney often. Don't ask me if I have enough light sabers🤺
