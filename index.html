        <h2>📜 About Me 📜 </h2>
        <p>
          *Record Scratch* Yep, that's me, you're probably wondering how I got here. It all started back in 1998, a child was born on a Tuesday afternoon in November. One drop of the head later; I woke up 23 years later, a student in Computer Science, 
          Studying at Franklin University in Columbus, Ohio a year away from graduating. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Jokes aside, I graduated from Central Ohio Technical College in 2021 with an Associate's Degree, double major in IT Specialism and Software Programming Development. 
          I originally intended to stop there, but once I got close to graduation, I decided I wanted to continue and develop my skills in Computer Science at Franklin University.

        </p>

        <p>
          As of right now, I am currently looking for Software Engineering Internships/Full-Time positions, preferably remote or around Orlando, FL area.
        </p>

        <h2>🎸 Bio 🎸</h2>
        <p>I am an avid fan of video games, whether it be discussing the most niche game on the GameCube to raiding in World of Warcraft! Some of my other interests are lifting and writing/playing music (Really into rock/metal and hiphop).</p>
